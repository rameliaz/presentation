## Theoretical Background

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.smaller}

* **Barbour's Taxonomy** [@barbourIssuesScienceReligion1966; @barbourReligionScienceHistorical1998; @barbourWhenScienceMeets2000; @barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002] proposes that people can perceive ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} as:
  * **Conflict**: [inherently incompatible]{.mark}, then cannot mentally coexist.
  * **Independence**: [separate domains]{.mark} or non-overlapping *magisteria* [@gouldNonOverlappingMagisteria1999]
  * **Dialogue**: [distinct but incomplete]{.mark} without each other.
  * **Integration**: a [unified belief system]{.mark} with no categorical distinction.

* **Assumptions**: The qualitative distinctions between *taxons* are **delicate**, not firm and they are **situation-dependent** characteristics [@barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002].
* Perceptions of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} **is hereby defined as** a [mental schema]{.mark} for [processing potentially competing explanations]{.mark} and is expected to predict how people [interpret, evaluate, and respond]{.mark} to situations in which both scientific and religious explanations are salient. 
* For brevity, I will refer to this construct as ['**mental models**']{.mark} later on.

![](img/pillar1/man1.png){.center}

<!-- Manuscript 1: Theoretical Foundations #4 -->

## Some Insights {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

#### Is the taxonomy real? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* There is [handful of evidence]{.mark} from [qualitative studies](#a3) for Barbour's taxonomy, mostly in learning sciences, but they are, by and large, fragmented.
* Mental models have different names, but the most straightforward are suggested by @yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013, which are [**Conflict**]{.mark}, [**Compartment**]{.mark} (= *Independence*), [**Complementary**]{.mark} (= *Dialogue*) and [**Consonance**]{.mark} (= *Integration*).
* [**Context-Switch**]{.mark} is the newest addition [@shipmanChangesStudentViews2002; @taberSecondaryStudentsResponses2011; @yasriUnderstandingStudentApproaches2012], which represents a pragmatic strategy of an **underlying conflict belief** by [**flexibly switching**]{.mark} between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} depending on the social situations, cues or demands.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Why people differ? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* [**Cognitive elements**]{.mark}: cognitive flexibility, epistemic belief.
* [**Motivational elements**]{.mark}: social identity, political ideology, moral belief, epistemic needs and motives.
* Differences in cognitive and motivational aspects here pave the way for [**explanatory coexistence**]{.mark} [@legareCoexistenceNaturalSupernatural2012; @legareBewitchmentBiologyBoth2008].

* Explanatory coexistence can occur because ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} have **differential utility** [@davoodiExplainingExistentialScientific2022] and thus are **processed differently** [@vanleeuwenReligiousCredenceNot2014].

:::

:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
People give different labels to the same model description. For example, "independence" is labelled as "compartment" or "NOMA".

So here context-switchers, for example, would use science for school, religion for family gathering in Christmas.

Explanatory coexistence refers to the simultaneous use of natural (scientific) and supernatural (religious) explanations for one phenomenon, with three different levels of integration: target-dependent/surface level, synthetic/moderate level, integrative thinking/deep level of integration.  

:::

<!-- Manuscript 1: Main Arguments #4 -->

## 

![](img/pillar1/flowchart_simplified.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

::: {.notes}

Here is a simplified version of the flowchart presented in the article. As can be seen here, people can only adopt non-conflict beliefs when they are willing to be cognitively flexible and motivated to reconcile. By then, they would utilize explanatory coexistence, and depending on the level of integration they desire, they could adopt compartment, complementary or consonance views. Those whose cognitive and motivational elements do not satisfy these conditions would instead adopt a conflict belief. They may favor religion or science, but if they have no specific preference, they will adopt a context-switch view.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 2: Title #5 -->

## Manuscript ![](resources/two.svg){.icon}: Measurement

![](img/pillar2/man2.png){.center}

::: {.notes}
We learned from the first pillar that Barbour's taxonomy does exist in reality and comes with five, not four, types. Then the next question would be, how can one systematically investigate them for empirical research? and this is the focus of the second manuscript.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 2: Rationale + Theoretical Background #6 -->

## Rationale 

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* There have been some efforts to operationalize Barbour's taxonomy [@johnsonScienceGodCosmos2019; @johnsonInteractionFaithScience2023; @marinHowPeoplePerceive2021; @woolleyTeachersPerspectivesRelationship2023; @yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013], but they did ***not*** satisfy Barbour's most important assumption: [**delicate boundaries**]{.mark} between the mental models.
* One way to operationalize the taxonomy is to assume that mental models do not only differ in their [***kind***]{.mark} but also in their [***degree***]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

:::
:::

:::
:::


::: {.notes}
There have been some efforts...

Barbour proposes taxonomy but he cautions people not to put people into boxes and that what these studies did. And it is somewhat counterintuitive to propose a taxonomy but then tell people not to use it for categorizing people.

:::

## 

![](img/pillar2/continuum.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
So here is the visual illustration of our measurement assumptions. Here we have two assumptions: the mental models differ both qualitatively (differences in kind), but also quantitatively (or differences in degree). Ideally, we wanted to capture both of these assumptions in the measurement model.
 
:::

## Rationale 


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* There have been some efforts to operationalize Barbour's taxonomy [@johnsonScienceGodCosmos2019; @johnsonInteractionFaithScience2023; @marinHowPeoplePerceive2021; @woolleyTeachersPerspectivesRelationship2023; @yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013], but they did ***not*** satisfy Barbour's most important assumption: [**delicate boundaries**]{.mark} between the mental models.
* One way to operationalize the taxonomy is to assume that mental models do not only differ in their [***kind***]{.mark} but also in their [***degree***]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

:::
:::

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.smaller}
* We developed [**a novel measure**]{.mark} that mirrors *theoretical* and *empirical* descriptions of mental models
* ..and assumed that people would respond to the scale items by following an [***unfolding*** **(Thurstone) response process**]{.mark} [@carterUnderstandingPsychologyUnfolding2010; @robertsGeneralizedGradedUnfolding2018].
* We performed one pilot and two studies across three ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} (*N* = 2,920) and one ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} sample (*N* = 1,197).
* Since mental models are [culturally embedded]{.mark} [@johnsonIntersectionScienceReligion2020; @riosSciencereligionCompatibilityBeliefs2019; @riosMesearchNecessarilyLess2020], the scale might contain systematic cultural bias, so DIF analysis was a necessity.
* Discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity were also examined.

:::
:::

:::
:::


::: {.notes}
We went through those qualitative studies on Barbour's taxonomy to formulate the items. 

...and the unfolding assumption here is important for differences in both kind and degree assumptions, because we were dealing with preference data and we need to differentiate people who like to position themselves in the middle of the continuum. And these people usually disagree with the extremes in both direction. We tested this unfolding assumption by comparing unfolding model with the dominant Likert/linear model to see which one fitted better to the scale data.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 2: Main Findings #7 -->

## Results

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.smaller}
* Scale data in four samples show that the construct is [**unidimensional and bipolar**]{.mark}. 
  * ..but the [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to compatibility than conflict, unlike previously hypothesized.
* Generalized Graded [**Unfolding**]{.mark} Model (GGUM) [fit better to the data]{.mark} than Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM - **Likert**) in all samples.
* ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} participants perceive [**more conflict**]{.mark} than ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} at same trait level by ~0.4SD (ETSSD = 0.419).
* The construct is [conceptually distinct]{.mark} from Belief in Science [@fariasScientificFaithBelief2013] ($\rho^2$ = .46 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}, .25 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}) and [similar to]{.mark} @leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021 scale ($\rho^2$ = .57 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} .54 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}), but sufficient unshared variance still left.
* **Religiosity**, **religious identity**, and **religious upbringing** are associated with [**higher compatibility**]{.mark} perceptions in both ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} samples.

:::
:::

:::
:::

![](img/pillar2/pca.png){.image-right}

::: {.notes}
We ran principal component analysis and these biplot here tell us that the construct is unidimensional and bipolar. The plots here maybe a bit too small, but the general pattern that is clear here from afar is that the items lined up like a horseshoe where the extremes: conflict and consonance are grouped in the opposite directions while here in the middle we see compartment items, then context-switch and complementary. 

But unlike initially suspected, context-switch here are closer to compatibility than to conflict.

<!-- Manuscript 3: Title #8 -->

## Manuscript ![](resources/three.svg){.icon}: Mechanistic Testing

![](img/pillar3/man3.png){.center}

::: {.notes}
We learned from the second part of the project that religious people tend to see compatibility between sci and rel, but why many previous studies demonstrated that religious individuals, even though they tend to see compatibility between science and religion, trust science less than non-religious people.

Again, Barbour's taxonomy doesn't say anything about what it predicts so we need a help from existing theories.

In this case, we have two theories offering different predictions.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Rationale + Theoretical Background #9 -->

## Rationale & Theory {.center}

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

#### Goal System Theory (GST) {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} are *means* to achieve epistemic *goals* (i.e., "to explain why things happen").
* GST predicts that presenting scientific and religious explanations together (as **multiple means**) leads to [**reduced**]{.mark} **perceived utility** of [**both**]{.mark} compared to presenting them *alone* (i.e., the [**dilution effect**]{.mark}, @kruglanskiHowManyRoads2011; @belangerMoreLessEffect2015).
* Religious people relied on ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *and* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} moderately, but non-religious people relied on ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} highly [@jacksonReligiousPeopleView2024].
* Therefore, [**the number of available (scientific and/or religious) explanations**]{.mark} determines how epistemically valuable people perceive these explanations to be.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Motivated Reasoning {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* [**Prior beliefs**]{.mark} play a more important role in determining how epistemically useful people perceive (scientific and/or religious) explanations to be.
* People engage in [**biased reasoning**]{.mark}, preferring explanations that are [**consistent with**]{.mark} their prior beliefs [@kundaCaseMotivatedReasoning1990; @dittoMotivatedSkepticismUse1992].
* [**Moderate reliance on both**]{.mark} ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *and* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} probably reflects underlying [**non-conflict**]{.mark} beliefs (i.e., compartment, context-switch, complementary, and consonance).
* [**High reliance on either**]{.mark} ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *or* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} possibly reflects an underlying [**conflict**]{.mark} belief.

:::

::: {.notes}
The dilution effect here implies that sci and rel can be seen as substitutes so people would rely less on them or to put simply, "all roads lead to Rome"

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Design #10 -->

## Design

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* A **within-subject** experiment (*N* = 719)
* Participants were randomly presented with [**one**]{.mark} (scientific *or* religious), [**two**]{.mark} (always one scientific *and* one religious), and [**four**]{.mark} (always two scientific *and* two religious) of three existential-related incidents [@poltHeideggerIntroduction1999; @sullivanComprehensiveUnderstandingExistential2012]: [**flood**]{.mark}, [**war**]{.mark}, and [**climate crisis**]{.mark}.
* The order of both *incidents* and *number of explanations* was [**counterbalanced**]{.mark} so that each condition only appeared **once** (Latin square design).
* Then, asked participants to rate [***each*** explanation]{.mark} presented to them for their [epistemic utility](#c1), and measured their perceptions of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon}, and religiosity.

:::

## Some Takeaways {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Conclusion** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Manuscript ![](resources/one.svg){.icon}: People's perceptions on the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} emerge through identifiable [cognitive]{.mark} and [motivational]{.mark} processes.
- Manuscript ![](resources/two.svg){.icon}: These perceptions are mapped on to **different regions** of a [unidimensional, bipolar]{.mark} construct, that is **culturally embedded**.
  - But [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to compatibility than conflict.
  
- Manuscript ![](resources/three.svg){.icon}: This general perception of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} [***only*** predicts]{.mark} how people evaluate the utility of [religious explanations]{.mark}, but *not* scientific explanations.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Contributions** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Offering a **systematic operationalization** of Barbour's taxonomy [@barbourReligionScienceHistorical1998; @barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002].
- Providing an **integrative, yet descriptive**, psychological mechanism underlying the mental models and **early evidence** for what they predict.

:::

##### **Limitations** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- *No* examination of boundary conditions ![](resources/arrow-right.svg){.icon} only possible with computational modelling. 
- Only focused on the general perceptions -- did *not* tap into domain/issue/topic-specific perceptions [@leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021].

## Where to go from here?

- Do mental models predict how people [change/update]{.mark} their scientific/religious beliefs?
- Are models [stable]{.mark} characteristics or [situation-dependent]{.mark}? What are the [boundary conditions]{.mark}? (e.g., uncertainty? death-related events? threatened social identity?)
- Could the models play a role on people's [decision making]{.mark} on various aspects of their life? (e.g., public-health/sustainability-related decision making, etc.)
- Could science communication strategy [be personalized]{.mark} based on one's preferred model? If so, would it be practically useful?

At last, some open questions still remain regarding how these mental models predict belief change and decision making, whether they are stable or situation-dependent, and whether personalizing science communication according to one's mental models would be practically useful. These are questions that future research can hopefully answer.

Thank you so much for your attention! I would welcome any questions or concerns that you might have.
