## Theoretical Background

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.smaller}

* Barbour [(1966, 1998, 2000, 2002)]{.much-smaller} proposes that people can perceive science (S) and religion (R) as:
  * Conflict: [inherently incompatible]{.mark}, thus cannot mentally coexist.
  * Independence: [non-overlapping]{.mark} domains [(Gould, 1999)]{.much-smaller}.
  * Dialogue: [distinct but incomplete]{.mark} without each other.
  * Integration: a [unified belief system]{.mark} with no distinction.

* Assumptions: (1) one [cannot fit]{.mark} people neatly [into one]{.mark} category and (2) the taxonomy is [situation-dependent]{.mark} [(Barbour, 2002)]{.much-smaller}.
* Perceptions of the relationship between S and R are [mental schemas]{.mark} that represent how these domains relate and [guide interpretation of potentially competing S and R explanations]{.mark}. 
* I will refer to this construct as ['mental models']{.mark}.

Despite widely cited, Barbour's taxonomy has gaps in at least three aspects which I addressed as a focus in my dissertation.

## Manuscript 1: Theory
#### Does Barbour's taxonomy exist in reality? If so, why do people differ in their mental models?

<!-- Manuscript 1: Theoretical Foundations #4 -->

## Some Insights {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Is the taxonomy real? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* There is [handful of evidence]{.mark} from qualitative studies.
* Mental models have different names, but the most straightforward are suggested by Yasri et al [(2013)]{.much-smaller}, which are [Conflict]{.mark}, [Compartment]{.mark} (= *Independence*), [Complementary]{.mark} (= *Dialogue*) and [Consonance]{.mark} (= *Integration*).
* [Context-Switch]{.mark} is an addition, which represents a pragmatic strategy of an underlying conflict belief by [flexibly switching]{.mark} between S and R depending on the social situations.

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Why people differ? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* [Cognitive elements]{.mark}: cognitive flexibility, epistemic belief.
* [Motivational elements]{.mark}: social identity, political ideology, moral belief, epistemic needs and motives.
* Differences in cognitive and motivational elements pave the way for [explanatory coexistence]{.mark} [(Legare et al., 2012; Legare & Visala, 2011)]{.much-smaller}.
* Explanatory coexistence occurs because individuals use S and R for [different purposes]{.mark} [(Davoodi & Lombrozo, 2022)]{.much-smaller}.
* S and R are [processed differently]{.mark} [(Van Leeuwen, 2014)]{.much-smaller}.

:::
:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

In the article we provided two main insights:

Context-switchers would use science for school, religion for family gathering at Christmas.

Explanatory coexistence is a culturally universal phenomenon, where people simultaneously use natural (scientific) and supernatural (religious) explanations for the same phenomenon.

<!-- Manuscript 1: Main Arguments #5 -->

## 

![](img/pillar1/flowchart_simplified.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

::: {.notes}

We illustrate how cognitive and motivational elements determine how people adopt these mental models in a flowchart, but this is the simplified version.

Two decision diamonds represent cognitive flexibility and motivational forces required for the activation of explanatory coexistence. If these condition aren't met, people adopt conflict.

In the second manuscript, we shift the focus from conceptual to operational level. Therefore, this manuscript deals with operationalization through measurement.

<!-- Manuscript 2: Rationale + Theoretical Background #8 -->

## Rationale & Design

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* Barbour introduces a taxonomy, but he cautions [not to use it for categorizing]{.mark} people [(2002)]{.much-smaller}.
* As a workaround, we assume that mental models do not only differ in their [kind]{.mark} but also in their [degree]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

When talking about operationalization, we faced a problem....

To understand these two assumptions better, let me revisit the taxonomy with an example.

From these examples, we could conclude that mental models are qualitatively different from each other and this is what I meant by "differences in kind"

## 

<div style="height: 2.5em;"></div>

![](img/pillar2/continuum2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
In addition to qualitative differences, we can also order this mental models based on their degree of conflict to compatibility, where "conflict" and "consonance" sit in the opposite direction. While here in the middle, we have context-switch, compartment and complementary.

* Barbour introduces a taxonomy, but he cautions [not to use it for categorizing]{.mark} people [(2002)]{.much-smaller}.
* As a workaround, we assume that mental models do not only differ in their [kind]{.mark} but also in their [degree]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.
* To test Barbour's claims, we developed [a novel measure]{.mark} that mirrors theoretical and empirical descriptions of each mental model.

* We performed one pilot and two studies across three ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} (*N* = 2,920) and one ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} sample (*N* = 1,197).
* Since mental models are [culturally embedded]{.mark} [(Johnson, et al., 2020; Rios & Aveyard, 2019; Rios & Roth, 2020)]{.much-smaller}, we performed a differential item functioning (DIF) analysis.
* Discriminant (vs. Belief in Science, [Farias et al., 2013]{.much-smaller}), convergent (vs. [Leicht et al., 2021]{.much-smaller}), and criterion-related validity were also tested.

To test this...

* ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} participants perceived [more conflict]{.mark} than ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} with the same trait level by ~0.4SD.
* The construct was [empirically distinct]{.mark} from Belief in Science [(Farias et al., 2013)]{.much-smaller} ($\rho^2$ = .46 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}, .25 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}) and [similar to]{.mark} Leicht et al.'s [(2021)]{.much-smaller} scale ($\rho^2$ = .57 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}, .54 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}), but [substantial unshared variance]{.mark} still left.
* Religious participants who have a stronger religious identity and were brought up in a religious family tended to perceive [higher compatibility]{.mark}, both in ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} samples.
* Participants with stronger identification with atheism were more likely to construe [an intense conflict]{.mark}, both in ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}.

<!-- Manuscript 3: Title #11 -->

## Manuscript ![](resources/three.svg){.icon}: Mechanistic Testing
#### What does having different mental models predict?

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

![](img/pillar3/man3.png){.center}

::: {.notes}

We learned from the past manuscript that religious participants tend to see compatibility between sci and rel. However, this contradicts many previous studies showing that religious individuals, even though they tend to see compatibility between science and religion, trust science less than non-religious individuals.

Barbour's doesn't say anything about this so we used two theories that offer different predictions.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Rationale + Theoretical Background #12 -->

## Rationale & Theory {.center}

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Goal System Theory (GST) {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* S and R are *means* to achieve epistemic *goals* (i.e., "to explain why things happen").
* Presenting scientific and religious explanations together (as multiple means) leads to [reduced]{.mark} perceived utility of [both]{.mark} compared to presenting them alone, or the [dilution effect]{.mark} [(Jackson et al., 2024; Kruglanski et al., 2011)]{.much-smaller}.
* GST predicts that: [the number of available explanations]{.mark} determines how epistemically valuable people perceive these explanations to be.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Motivated Reasoning {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* People engage in [biased reasoning]{.mark}, preferring explanations that are consistent with their [prior beliefs]{.mark} [(Kunda, 1990)]{.much-smaller}.
* Motivated reasoning predicts that:
  * [Moderate reliance on both]{.mark} S *and* R reflects underlying [non-conflict]{.mark} beliefs (i.e., compartment, context-switch, complementary, and consonance).
  * [High reliance on either]{.mark} S *or* R reflects an underlying [conflict]{.mark} belief.

:::
:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
The dilution effect here implies that sci and rel are seen as substitutes so people would rely less on them. 

This aligns with a metaphor that "all roads lead to Rome". 

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Design #13 -->

## Design

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* A within-subject experiment (*N* = 719)
* Participants were randomly presented with [one]{.mark} (scientific *or* religious), [two]{.mark} (always one scientific *and* one religious), and [four]{.mark} (always two scientific *and* two religious) of three existential-related incidents: [flood]{.mark}, [war]{.mark}, and [climate crisis]{.mark}.
* Then, we asked participants to rate [each explanation]{.mark} presented to them for their epistemic utility, and measured their perceptions of the relationship between S and R, and religiosity.

:::
:::
:::
:::

![](img/pillar3/exp.png){.image-right}

::: {.notes}
To test the explanatory power of these hypotheses, we performed...

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Main Arguments #14 -->

## Results

::: incremental
::: {.smaller}
* [*No* main effect]{.mark} of number of explanation (1 vs. 2 vs. 4) and [*no* interaction effect]{.mark} between number of explanation and type of explanation (S vs. R).
* [Conflict believers]{.mark} rated [religious explanations as less useful]{.mark} than non-conflict believers (*d* = -0.71). 
* [Scientific explanations]{.mark} were rated [consistently]{.mark} regardless of whether participants believed in a conflict or non-conflict (*d* = 0.001).
* [Non-religious]{.mark} rated [religious explanations as less useful]{.mark} than religious participants (*d* = -1.02). 
* [Scientific explanations]{.mark} were rated [similarly]{.mark} regardless of participants' religiosity (*d* = 0.09).

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
So this mean we didn't find any support of the dilution effect hypothesis.

We found some evidence for the motivated reasoning hypothesis, but it only assymetrically applies to religious explanations.

## Some Takeaways {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Conclusion** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- People's perceptions on the relationship between S and R emerge through identifiable [cognitive]{.mark} and [motivational]{.mark} processes.
- These perceptions are mapped on to different regions of a [unidimensional, bipolar]{.mark} construct, that is culturally embedded.
  - [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to compatibility than conflict, different from what was initially suspected.
  
- This general perception of the relationship between S and R [only predicts]{.mark} how people evaluate the utility of [religious explanations]{.mark}, but *not* scientific explanations.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Contributions** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Offering a systematic operationalization of Barbour's taxonomy.
- Providing an integrative, yet descriptive, psychological mechanism underlying the mental models and early evidence for what they predict.

:::

##### **Limitations** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- *No* examination of boundary conditions, may be possible with computational modelling or experience sampling methods. 
- Only focused on the general perceptions -- did *not* tap into domain/issue/topic-specific perceptions.
