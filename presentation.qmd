## Theoretical Background

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.smaller}

* Barbour's Taxonomy [@barbourIssuesScienceReligion1966; @barbourReligionScienceHistorical1998; @barbourWhenScienceMeets2000; @barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002] proposes that people can perceive science (S) and religion (R) as:
  * Conflict: [inherently incompatible]{.mark}, then cannot mentally coexist.
  * Independence: [separate domains]{.mark} or non-overlapping *magisteria* [@gouldNonOverlappingMagisteria1999]
  * Dialogue: [distinct but incomplete]{.mark} without each other.
  * Integration: a [unified belief system]{.mark} with no categorical distinction.

* [Assumptions]{.mark}: one cannot fit people neatly into one *taxon* and they are situation-dependent characteristics [@barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002].
* Perceptions of the relationship between S and R is hereby defined as a [mental schema]{.mark} for [processing potentially competing explanations]{.mark} and is expected to predict how people [interpret, evaluate, and respond]{.mark} to situations in which both scientific and religious explanations are salient. 
* For brevity, I will refer to this construct as ['mental models']{.mark} later on.

Despite influential, Barbour's taxonomy is purely descriptive and remain silent in at least three following aspects.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 1: Title #3 -->

## Manuscript 1: Theory
#### Does Barbour's taxonomy exist in reality? If so, why do people differ in their mental models?

![](img/pillar1/man1.png){.center}

<!-- Manuscript 1: Theoretical Foundations #4 -->

## Some Insights {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Is the taxonomy real? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* There is [handful of evidence]{.mark} from qualitative studies.
* Mental models have different names, but the most straightforward are suggested by Yasri et al (2013), which are [Conflict]{.mark}, [Compartment]{.mark} (= *Independence*), [Complementary]{.mark} (= *Dialogue*) and [Consonance]{.mark} (= *Integration*).
* [Context-Switch]{.mark} is an addition, which represents a pragmatic strategy of an underlying conflict belief by [flexibly switching]{.mark} between S and R depending on the social situations.

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Why people differ? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* [Cognitive elements]{.mark}: cognitive flexibility, epistemic belief.
* [Motivational elements]{.mark}: social identity, political ideology, moral belief, epistemic needs and motives.
* Differences in cognitive and motivational aspects here pave the way for [explanatory coexistence]{.mark}.

* Explanatory coexistence can occur because S and R have [differential utility]{.mark} [@davoodiExplainingExistentialScientific2022] and thus are processed differently [@vanleeuwenReligiousCredenceNot2014].

:::
:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
People give different labels to the same model description. For example, "independence" is labelled as "compartment" or "NOMA".

So here context-switchers, for example, would use science for school, religion for family gathering in Christmas.

Explanatory coexistence is a culturally universal phenomenon, which refers to the simultaneous use of natural (scientific) and supernatural (religious) explanations for why something happens. 

:::

<!-- Manuscript 1: Main Arguments #5 -->

## 

![](img/pillar1/flowchart_simplified.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

::: {.notes}

We illustrate how cognitive and motivational elements determine how people adopt these mental models in a simplified version of the flowchart we presented in the article. As we can see here, people can only adopt non-conflict beliefs when they are willing to be cognitively flexible and motivated to reconcile science and religion. By then, they would utilize explanatory coexistence, and depending on the level of integration they desire, they could adopt compartment, complementary or consonance. Those whose cognitive and motivational elements do not satisfy these conditions would instead adopt a conflict belief by favoring either religion or science. However, if they have no specific preference, they would adopt a context-switch view.

<!-- Manuscript 2: Title #7 -->

## Manuscript 2: Measurement
#### How can one systematically operationalize Barbour's taxonomy for empirical research?

![](img/pillar2/man2.png){.center}

::: {.notes}
We learned from the first pillar that Barbour's taxonomy does exist in reality and comes with five, not four, types. Then the next question would be, how can one systematically investigate them for empirical research? and this is the focus of the second manuscript.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 2: Rationale + Theoretical Background #8 -->

## Rationale 

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* There have been some efforts to operationalize Barbour's taxonomy, but these studies violated Barbour's most important assumption by [assigning participants]{.mark} to one of the mental models.
* One way to operationalize the taxonomy is to assume that mental models do not only differ in their [kind]{.mark} but also in their [degree]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

:::
:::

:::
:::


::: {.notes}
There have been some efforts...

Barbour proposes taxonomy but he cautions people not to put people into boxes and that what these studies did. And it is somewhat counterintuitive to propose a taxonomy but then tell people not to use it for categorizing people.

:::

## 

![](img/pillar2/continuum1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The first assumption, differences in kind, can be better explained with an example for each mental model.
 
:::

## 

<div style="height: 2.5em;"></div>

![](img/pillar2/continuum2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
In addition to that, mental models can also imply certain degree of conflict-compatibility, where "conflict" and "consonance" sit in the opposite direction.
 
:::

## Rationale 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* There have been some efforts to operationalize Barbour's taxonomy, but they did *not* satisfy Barbour's most important assumption: [loose boundaries]{.mark} between the mental models.
* One way to operationalize the taxonomy is to assume that mental models do not only differ in their [kind]{.mark} but also in their [degree]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

:::
:::

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.smaller}
* We developed [a novel measure]{.mark} that mirrors theoretical and empirical descriptions of each mental model.
* We performed one pilot and two studies across three ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} (*N* = 2,920) and one ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} sample (*N* = 1,197).
* Since mental models are [culturally embedded]{.mark} [@johnsonIntersectionScienceReligion2020; @riosSciencereligionCompatibilityBeliefs2019; @riosMesearchNecessarilyLess2020], the scale might contain systematic cultural bias, so we performed DIF analysis.
* Discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity were also tested.

We went through those qualitative studies on Barbour's taxonomy to formulate the items.

## Results

* Scale data in four samples showed that the construct is [unidimensional and bipolar]{.mark}.
  * ..but the [Context-Switch]{.mark} was closer to compatibility than conflict.

::: {.incremental}
* ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} participants perceived [more conflict]{.mark} than ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} at same trait level by ~0.4SD.
* The construct was [conceptually distinct]{.mark} from Belief in Science (Farias et al., 2013) ($\rho^2$ = .46 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}, .25 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}) and [similar to]{.mark} Leicht et al.'s (2021) scale ($\rho^2$ = .57 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} .54 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}), but sufficient unshared variance still left.
* Strong-to-moderate correlations between religiosity, religious identity, and religious upbringing with [higher compatibility]{.mark} perceptions in ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} samples.
* Small-to-moderate correlations between atheist identity (both in ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}) and science identity (only ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}) with [conflict perception]{.mark}. 
* Close to zero correlation between agnostic identity with conflict/compatibility perceptions, both in ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} samples.

But unlike initially suspected, context-switch here are closer to compatibility than to conflict.

<!-- Manuscript 3: Title #11 -->

## Manuscript ![](resources/three.svg){.icon}: Mechanistic Testing
#### What does having different mental models predict?

![](img/pillar3/man3.png){.center}

::: {.notes}
We learned from the second part of the project that religious people tend to see compatibility between sci and rel, but why many previous studies demonstrated that religious individuals, even though they tend to see compatibility between science and religion, trust science less than non-religious people.

Again, Barbour's taxonomy doesn't say anything about what it predicts so we need a help from existing theories.

In this case, we have two theories offering different predictions.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Rationale + Theoretical Background #12 -->

## Rationale & Theory {.center}

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Goal System Theory (GST) {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* S and R are *means* to achieve epistemic *goals* (i.e., "to explain why things happen").
* GST predicts that presenting scientific and religious explanations together (as multiple means) leads to [reduced]{.mark} perceived utility of [both]{.mark} compared to presenting them alone, or the [dilution effect]{.mark}, [@kruglanskiHowManyRoads2011; @jacksonReligiousPeopleView2024].
* Therefore, [the number of available explanations]{.mark} determines how epistemically valuable people perceive these explanations to be.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Motivated Reasoning {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* People engage in [biased reasoning]{.mark}, preferring explanations that are consistent with their [prior beliefs]{.mark} [@kundaCaseMotivatedReasoning1990].
* [Moderate reliance on both]{.mark} S *and* R probably reflects underlying [non-conflict]{.mark} beliefs (i.e., compartment, context-switch, complementary, and consonance).
* [High reliance on either]{.mark} S *or* R possibly reflects an underlying [conflict]{.mark} belief.

:::

:::


:::
:::

::: {.notes}
The dilution effect here implies that sci and rel can be seen as substitutes so people would rely less on them or to put simply, "all roads lead to Rome". Aligning to this prediction, previous research found that....

<!-- Manuscript 3: Design #13 -->

## Design

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* A within-subject experiment (*N* = 719)
* Participants were randomly presented with [one]{.mark} (scientific *or* religious), [two]{.mark} (always one scientific *and* one religious), and [four]{.mark} (always two scientific *and* two religious) of three existential-related incidents: [flood]{.mark}, [war]{.mark}, and [climate crisis]{.mark}.
* The order of both *incidents* and *number of explanations* was [counterbalanced]{.mark} so that each condition only appeared once.
* Then, asked participants to rate [each explanation]{.mark} presented to them for their epistemic utility, and measured their perceptions of the relationship between S and R, and religiosity.

![](img/pillar3/exp.png){.image-right}

To test the explanatory power of the dilution effect and motivated reasoning hypotheses, we performed...

...counterbalanced so that each condition only appeared once.

:::

<!-- Manuscript 3: Main Arguments #14 -->

## Results

::: incremental
::: {.smaller}
* [*No* main effect]{.mark} of *n* of explanation and [*no* interaction effect]{.mark} between *n* of explanation and type of explanation (S vs. R).
* Conflict believers rated religious explanations as less useful than non-conflict believers (*d* = -0.71). 
* [Scientific explanations]{.mark} were rated [consistently]{.mark} regardless of whether participants believed in a conflict or non-conflict (*d* = 0.001).
* Non-religious rated religious explanations lower than religious participants (*d* = -1.02). 
* [Scientific explanations]{.mark} were rated [similarly]{.mark} regardless of participants' religiosity (*d* = 0.09).

<!-- Conclusions, Contributions, and Limitations #12 -->

## Some Takeaways {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Conclusion** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- People's perceptions on the relationship between S and R emerge through identifiable [cognitive]{.mark} and [motivational]{.mark} processes.
- These perceptions are mapped on to different regions of a [unidimensional, bipolar]{.mark} construct, that is culturally embedded.
  - But [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to compatibility than conflict.
  
- This general perception of the relationship between S and R [only predicts]{.mark} how people evaluate the utility of [religious explanations]{.mark}, but *not* scientific explanations.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Contributions** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Offering a systematic operationalization of Barbour's taxonomy.
- Providing an integrative, yet descriptive, psychological mechanism underlying the mental models and early evidence for what they predict.

:::

##### **Limitations** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- *No* examination of boundary conditions, but it may be possible with computational modelling. 
- Only focused on the general perceptions -- did *not* tap into domain/issue/topic-specific perceptions [@leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021].
