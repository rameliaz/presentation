## Theoretical Background

::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.smaller}

* **Barbour's Taxonomy** [@barbourIssuesScienceReligion1966; @barbourReligionScienceHistorical1998; @barbourWhenScienceMeets2000; @barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002] assumes that people can perceive ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} as:
  * **Conflict**: inherently incompatible, then cannot mentally coexist.
  * **Independence**: separate domains or non-overlapping *magisteria* [@gouldNonOverlappingMagisteria1999]
  * **Dialogue**: distinct but incomplete without each other.
  * **Integration**: a unified belief system with no categorical distinction.

* **Assumptions**: The qualitative distinctions between *taxons* are delicate and they are situation-dependent characteristics [@barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002].
* Perceptions of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} **is hereby defined as** a [mental schema]{.mark} for [processing potentially competing explanations]{.mark} and is expected to predict how people [interpret, evaluate, and respond]{.mark} to situations in which both scientific and religious explanations are salient. 
* For brevity, I will refer to this construct as ['**mental models**']{.mark} later on.

::: {.notes}
The conquest started with a centuries-old question: are science and religion in conflict? While it's seemingly an outdated question, the idea how people actually perceive the relationship, regardless of whether or not substantive conflict exists, is a contemporary interest started only three decades ago. According to Barbour...

Barbour didn't really specify any working definition beyond arguing that these mental models represent subjective perceptions of the relationship between science and religion, so we define that this construct as...

While Barbour's taxonomy I mentioned earlier is very influential across different scientific disciplines and helpful in guiding interested researchers in this topic, the taxonomy is purely descriptive and remain silent in at least three following aspects.

![](img/pillar1/man1.png){.center}

<!-- Manuscript 1: Theoretical Foundations #4 -->

## Some Insights {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

#### Is the taxonomy real? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* There is [handful of evidence]{.mark} from qualitative studies for Barbour's taxonomy, mostly in learning sciences, but they are by and large fragmented.
* Mental models have different names but the most straightforward are suggested by @yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013, which are [**Conflict**]{.mark}, [**Compartment**]{.mark} (= *Independence*), [**Complementary**]{.mark} (= *Dialogue*) and [**Consonance**]{.mark} (= *Integration*).
* [**Context-Switch**]{.mark} is a new variant [@shipmanChangesStudentViews2002; @taberSecondaryStudentsResponses2011; @yasriUnderstandingStudentApproaches2012], which represents a pragmatic strategy of an **underlying conflict belief** by flexibly switching between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} depending on the social situation or demands.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Why people differ? {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* [**Cognitive elements**]{.mark}: cognitive flexibility, epistemic belief.
* [**Motivational elements**]{.mark}: social identity, political ideology, moral belief, epistemic needs and motives.
* Differences in cognitive and motivational aspects here pave the way for [**explanatory coexistence**]{.mark} [@legareCoexistenceNaturalSupernatural2012; @legareBewitchmentBiologyBoth2008].

* Explanatory coexistence can occur because ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} have **differential utility** [@davoodiExplainingExistentialScientific2022] and thus are **processed differently** [@vanleeuwenReligiousCredenceNot2014].

:::

:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
people give different labels to the same model description. For example, "independence" is labelled as "compartment" or "NOMA".

So here context-switchers, for example, would use science for school, religion for family gathering in Christmas.

Explanatory coexistence refers to the simultaneous use of natural (scientific) and supernatural (religious) explanations for one phenomenon.

## Rationale 

::: {.incremental}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* There have been some efforts to operationalize Barbour's taxonomy [@johnsonScienceGodCosmos2019; @johnsonInteractionFaithScience2023; @marinHowPeoplePerceive2021; @woolleyTeachersPerspectivesRelationship2023; @yasriRelatingScienceReligion2013], but they did ***not*** satisfy Barbour's most important assumption: [**fuzzy boundaries**]{.mark} between the mental models.
* One way to operationalize the taxonomy is to assume that mental models do not only differ in their [***kind***]{.mark} but also in their [***degree***]{.mark} of conflict ![](resources/arrow.svg){.icon} compatibility.

So here is the visual illustration of our measurement assumptions. Here we have two assumptions: the mental models differ both qualitatively (differences in kind), but also quantitatively (or differences in degree).

* We developed [**a novel measure**]{.mark} that mirrors *theoretical* and empirical descriptions of mental models
* ..and assumed that people would respond to the scale items by following an [***unfolding*** **(Thurstone) response process**]{.mark} [@carterUnderstandingPsychologyUnfolding2010; @robertsGeneralizedGradedUnfolding2018].
* We performed one pilot and three studies across three ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} (*N* = 2,920) and one ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} sample (*N* = 1,197).
* Since mental models are [culturally embedded]{.mark} [@johnsonIntersectionScienceReligion2020; @riosSciencereligionCompatibilityBeliefs2019; @riosMesearchNecessarilyLess2020], the scale might contain systematic cultural bias, so DIF analysis was a necessity.
* Discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity were also examined.

<!-- Manuscript 2: Main Findings #7 -->

## Results

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.smaller}
* Scale data in four samples show that the construct is [**unidimensional and bipolar**]{.mark}. 
  * ..but the [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to compatibility than conflict, unlike previously hypothesized.
* Generalized Graded [**Unfolding**]{.mark} Model (GGUM) [fit better to the data]{.mark} than Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM - **Likert**) in all samples.
* ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} participants perceive [**more conflict**]{.mark} than ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} at same trait level by ~0.4SD (ETSSD = 0.419).
* The construct is [conceptually distinct]{.mark} from Belief in Science [@fariasScientificFaithBelief2013] ($\rho^2$ = .46 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon}, .25 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}) and [similar to]{.mark} @leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021 scale ($\rho^2$ = .57 ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} .54 ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon}), but sufficient unshared variance still left.
* **Religiosity**, **religious identity**, and **religious upbringing** are associated with [**higher compatibility**]{.mark} perceptions in both ![](resources/de.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/usa.svg){.icon} samples.

## Rationale & Theory {.center}

::: {.incremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

#### Goal System Theory (GST) {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} are *means* to achieve epistemic *goals* (i.e., "to explain why things happen").
* GST predicts that presenting scientific and religious explanations together (as **multiple means**) leads to **reduced perceived utility** of both compared to presenting them alone (i.e., the "dilution effect", @kruglanskiHowManyRoads2011; @belangerMoreLessEffect2015).
* Religious people relied on ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *and* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} moderately, but non-religious people relied on ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} highly [@jacksonReligiousPeopleView2024].
* Therefore, [**the number of available (scientific and/or religious) explanations**]{.mark} determines how epistemically valuable people perceive these explanations to be.

:::

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Motivated Reasoning {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
* Prior beliefs play a more important role in determining how epistemically useful people perceive (scientific and/or religious) explanations to be.
* People engage in biased reasoning, preferring explanations that are consistent with their prior beliefs [@kundaCaseMotivatedReasoning1990; @dittoMotivatedSkepticismUse1992].
* [**Moderate reliance on**]{.mark} ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *and* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} probably reflects underlying [non-conflict]{.mark} beliefs (i.e., compartment, context-switch, complementary, and consonance).
* [**High reliance on either**]{.mark} ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} *or* ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} possibly reflects an underlying [conflict]{.mark} belief.

:::

:::


:::
:::

::: {.notes}
We learned from the previous pillar that religious people tend to see compatibility between sci and rel, but why many previous studies demonstrated that they trust science less than non-religious people. Again, Barbour's taxonomy lacks fully specified mechanism regarding what it predicts.

Here we'd like to examine if the general perception of the relationship between sci and rel can explain how people see the epistemic value of a very specific explanation.

There are two theories offering different, but not necessarily mutually exclusive predictions.

Equifinality: sci and rel are seen as substitutable "all roads lead to Rome"

## Design

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.smaller}
* A **within-subject** experiment (N = 719)
* Participants were randomly presented with ![](resources/one.svg){.icon} (scientific *or* religious), ![](resources/two.svg){.icon} (always one scientific *and* one religious), and ![](resources/four.svg){.icon} (always two scientific *and* two religious) of three existential-related incidents [@poltHeideggerIntroduction1999; @sullivanComprehensiveUnderstandingExistential2012]: [**flood**]{.mark}, [**war**]{.mark}, and [**climate crisis**]{.mark}.
* The order of both incidents and number of explanations was **counterbalanced** using a Latin square design.
* Then, asked participants to rate each explanation presented to them for their epistemic utility (a 4-item, 7-point Likert scale), their perceptions of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon}, and religiosity.

<!-- Conclusions, Contributions, and Limitations #12 -->

## Some Takeaways {.center}

::: {.incremental}
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Conclusion** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Manuscript ![](resources/one.svg){.icon}: People's perceptions on the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} emerge through identifiable [cognitive]{.mark} and [motivational]{.mark} processes.
- Manuscript ![](resources/two.svg){.icon}: These perceptions are mapped on to [different regions]{.mark} of a [unidimensional, bipolar]{.mark} construct, that is [culturally embedded]{.mark}.
  - But [Context-Switch]{.mark} is closer to [compatibility]{.mark} than conflict.
  
- Manuscript ![](resources/three.svg){.icon}: This general perception of the relationship between ![](resources/science.svg){.icon} and ![](resources/religion.svg){.icon} [only predicts]{.mark} how people evaluate the [utility]{.mark} of [religious explanations]{.mark}, but *not* scientific explanations.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Contributions** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- Offering a [systematic operationalization]{.mark} of Barbour's taxonomy [@barbourReligionScienceHistorical1998; @barbourTypologiesRelatingScience2002].
- Providing an integrative, but [descriptive]{.mark}, psychological mechanism underlying the mental models and [early evidence]{.mark} for what they predict.

:::

##### **Limitations** {.center .fragment}

::: {.smaller}
- *No* examination of boundary conditions ![](resources/arrow-right.svg){.icon} only possible with computational modelling. 
- Only focused on the general perceptions -- did *not* tap into domain/issue/topic-specific perceptions [@leichtContentMattersPerceptions2021].

## Where to go from here?

- Do mental models predict how people [change/update]{.mark} their scientific/religious beliefs?
- Are models [stable]{.mark} characteristics or [situation-dependent]{.mark}? What are the [boundary conditions]{.mark}? (e.g., uncertainty? death-related events? threatened social identity?)
- Could the models play a role on people's [decision making]{.mark} on various aspects of their life? (e.g., public-health/sustainability-related decision making, etc.)
- Could science communication strategy [be personalized]{.mark} based on one's preferred model? If so, would it be practically useful?
